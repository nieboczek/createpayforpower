# Create: Pay for Power
Making others pay for your stress (units)

# Features
## Power Meter
Measure how much ksuh (kilo stress unit hours) a network is using.  
[INSERT COOL GUI PICTURE OR SOMETHING]

## Network Stress Limiter
Limits stress units available to a network.  
[IDK IF I SHOULD EVEN INSERT STUFF HERE, IT PROBABLY WOULD BE NICE TO INSERT SOMETHING HERE TO BE CONSISTENT BUT DO I CARE?]

<!-- remove the entire thing after it goes to the release state -->
# Development status
Not yet finished.  
If you want to help me develop this, go ahead and make a pull request.  
Will not be accepting any PR changing PowerMeterScreen or the GUI textures.  
Don't forget to comment on the situation at `PowerMeterBlockEntity.java:38`! (not necessary)

<!-- I kinda want to keep this as a joke and also as useful information, maybe rename the header to some better name -->
### note to self
1 ksuh = 1000su for 1 hour
